Very quick recipe for boiling shrimp. Usually the best season for shrimp is around late summer. If you make them at home, its a much better deal than at a restaurant. Good natural source of Iodine. Need: 1 pound shrimp, Old Bay seasoning, Louisiana cocktail sauce, big pot and a strainer.

1. Fill half a large pot with water + 2 tbsps Old Bay
2. Bring to a strong boil
3. Add shrimp, cook those bad boys for 3-4 minutes until one or two float
4. Drain and put on ice to prevent overcooking
5. Peel and eat with cocktail sauce
